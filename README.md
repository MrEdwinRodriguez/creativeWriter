# Writer's Block :pencil2:

Break through your *Writer's Block* and improve your creative writing skills.

To begin, you'll be provided with an image as a writing prompt and given only 20 minutes to
develop a story of your choosing. This time range has been scientifically proven
to provoke creativity, decrease procrastination, and simultaneously test your critical
thinking skills.

Once completed, our experienced mentors will provide you with constructive
feedback to help you understand principles common to analytical writing, while
preparing you for multi-genre projects that embrace academic thinking.

*Writer's Block* is free to try for seven days, and only $100 a month on a
subscription.
